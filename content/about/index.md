The Helpful Badger loves technology. He travels the world looking for interesting technology topics and shares his perspective on what he finds.

If you see him out it the woods seeking his next adventure, offer him a StarBucks Pike Place coffee. He'll gladly pull up a chair and talk tech with you!
